            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate from Northern Illinois University, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences. My studies focused on environmental health, physical and mental health, and how to best deliver care to underserved communities. Studying throughout the pandemic revealed a host of challenges present within our healthcare system, challenges that were met with solutions from myself and my peers. Outside of Health, I have always loved working with computers. I am happy to finally be pursuing education and knowledge on the coding side of computers as I have always wanted to play a role in software development. Looking forward specifically to Java and Javascript within WeCanCodeIT, and also have interest in learning C++, Python, and .NET on my own.  </p>
