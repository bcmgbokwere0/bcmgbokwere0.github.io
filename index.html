            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a recent graduate from NIU, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences. My studies focused on public health, and how to best deliver care to underserved communities. Studying throughout the pandemic has revealed a host of challenges present within our healthcare system, challenges that were met with solutions from myself and my peers. I believe that my ability to collaborate with others is my strongest skills, and stems largely from my healthcare volunteering experience. Seeking a full-time job following my graduation in August 2022.</p>
